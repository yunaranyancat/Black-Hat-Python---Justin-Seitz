In this repo, I will demonstrate to you my hands-on experience with Python programming specifically as guided by
the book : Black Hat Python (Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters).

There will be two separate folders, Tuto is for all of the tutorials mentioned in the book while Projects folder is my own version of the programs created by Tuto.
